  <h2>Youtuber & Gamer</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Nahyan Ibn Hasan, a Youtuber and Gamer. I have one YouTube channel named <strong>Nahyan Alpha</strong> with the handle: <code>@NahyanAlpha</code>.

  <!-- About Me -->
  <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Nahyan Ibn Hasan, and I am a student of Hello Kids International School. I am currently studying in Grade 4, and I created this website at this young age!

    Ever since I started using computers, I became very interested in how websites, apps, and games are made. That curiosity inspired me to learn about coding and technology. I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and being creative with computers.

    One day, I want to become a professional software engineer and build amazing apps, websites, and programs that can help people around the world. I know it's a big dream, but I'm ready to work hard and keep learning until I achieve it.

    This is my first personal website, and I made it when I was in Grade 4. I‚Äôm really excited to share it with you!

<p>
  I have a lot of experience playing different types of games, and over time, they have become a big part of my life. My favorite types of games are parkour, racing, and creative building games. These games are not only fun but also very helpful for developing skills like thinking, planning, and solving problems quickly.
</p>

<p>
  One of the games I enjoy the most is <strong>Minecraft</strong>. In Minecraft, I explore big worlds, build amazing structures, and play parkour maps that test my jumping and timing skills. It teaches me how to use logic and creativity to solve puzzles and build things that look cool and work well. I‚Äôve learned how to plan ahead, gather resources, and stay focused for a long time while playing.
</p>

<p>
  Another game I really like is <strong>Crashday Redline Edition</strong>. It‚Äôs a fast-paced racing game where I can drive cars, crash, do stunts, and enjoy powerful action. I love how the game feels realistic, and it gives me the excitement of driving while also needing fast thinking and quick reactions. The fun part is building cars and tracks too, which helps me understand how design and movement work.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Roblox</strong> is also one of my top favorite games. Roblox is not just one game‚Äîit‚Äôs thousands of games in one! I can play obstacle courses, adventure missions, racing, and even role-play. I also like that many Roblox games are made by other kids and teenagers. That inspires me to want to make games too, and it shows me what‚Äôs possible when people learn to code and create their own ideas. Roblox has helped me think more about how games are designed and made.
</p>

<p>
  Through these games, I‚Äôve learned more than just how to play‚ÄîI‚Äôve learned how to focus better, how to make fast decisions, how to think logically, and how to be creative. I‚Äôve even started to understand some basic coding ideas by seeing how these games work. Sometimes I try to guess how a game was made or what kind of code is behind the scenes. That makes me excited to keep learning more about game design and software engineering.
</p>

<p>
  Gaming has also improved my hand-eye coordination, teamwork, and patience. When I fail a level or challenge, I don‚Äôt give up‚ÄîI try again and again until I get better. That teaches me to never stop trying and to believe in myself, which is something important not only in games but also in real life.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, playing Minecraft, Crashday Redline Edition, and Roblox has been a fun and educational experience. I don‚Äôt just play to win‚ÄîI play to learn, to improve, and to get inspired. These games helped me discover my love for technology, and they are a big reason why I want to become a software engineer in the future.
